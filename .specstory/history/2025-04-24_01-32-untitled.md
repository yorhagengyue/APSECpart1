I'll help you push these files to your GitHub repository. Let's run the necessary Git commands:

```bash
git status
```

```
PS C:\Users\gengy\Desktop\TP Year2> git status
PS C:\Users\gengy\Desktop\TP Year2>

```

Let's initialize a Git repository in this folder, set up the remote, and push your files to GitHub:

---

```bash
git init
```

```
PS C:\Users\gengy\Desktop\TP Year2> git init
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/gengy/Desktop/TP Year2/.git/
PS C:\Users\gengy\Desktop\TP Year2>
